c: How much does the codon distribution change between sequences?
Look at the standard deviation of codon counts for all codons across all sequences.
Which is the codon with the largest standard deviation? What are the standard deviation and mean codon count for that codon? Do you think the sequences are mutating a lot, relative to your expectations?

As my result in FPp3c-std.csv shows, the largest std dev is GGT, with STDEV = 0.4637 and the mean is 47.197. I got these result by excel, so you won't see my code in .py file. From my perspective, there seems to be little different in these s-protein sequences, which is not the same as my expection. But in some way, this is the specific coding sequence of s-protein, and consider the time this virus came out is really short, the mutations might not be so obvious.
