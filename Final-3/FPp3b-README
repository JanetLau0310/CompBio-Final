Which codons are under-represented? Can you explain why, for any of the codons on this list?
TAA	21.0
TGA	4.0
TAG	4.0
CGA	13.0
TCG	1.0
- 3b-rare: when obs <= exp, the 1-3 is the stop codon, which I only count once ( but as the output shows, many sequence did not reach their 'STOP' codon. The other 2 codon are also appear rare in couting sequences, so it means the exp only consider the prob result rather than the real function of codon.
