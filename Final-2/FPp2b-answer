Do you believe that this network fits the definition of scale-free? Why or why not?

- I think this PPI Network is scale-free. As the degree sequence shows, there is one node whose degree can be 2950, but there are 142 nodes have degree=1, and 178 have degree = 2. I did some scaling work to my output image, without it the graph will shows really unbalanced.
- The other image named "Degree_Distribution.png" is the unbalanced one without scaling.
